Hello Sir/Madam,

You have recently sent spam email to a number of our staff. This is unacceptable, and arguably illegal under the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. Please cease and desist, and remove any email addresses containing our domain from your contacts list unless the individual has explicitly requested to receive mail from you.

Please reply to this message confirming your understanding and intent to comply. If no response is received within 72 hours, we will report this activity to the FTC, your registrar, and/or your email provider at our discretion.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
